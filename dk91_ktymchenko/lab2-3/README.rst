To demonstrate class mastery in python, a script was written containing: the parent class Cinema, the heir classes Film and Serial. The Season class is inherited from the Serial class. The __init__ constructor was used to implement the program.
- The Film class contains a description of the movie consisting of one part or a description of each part separately. 
- The Serial class describes the title, genre, number of seasons and years of the series. 
- The Season class displays information about a random season of the series.
